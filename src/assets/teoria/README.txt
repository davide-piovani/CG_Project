The Atoms folder contains the nuclei of four chemical elements.
Each element has the model of the nucleus and an approximate
model of the trajectories the electrons should follow
that you can use as reference.
Trajectories are either circles or ellipses.
Electrons should APPROXIMATELY follow them because 
guessing the exact parameters of those shapes would be
madness. 
The model of the electron is in the root folder.
All models share the same texture.
Hydrogen (H) only has 1 electron.
Helium (He) has 2 electrons.
Carbon (C) has 6 electrons.
Oxygen (O) has 8 electrons.
